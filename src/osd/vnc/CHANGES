v0.2, 10-DEC-2016:

- rebuilt from scratch for modern MAME's OSD interface
- Linux only for now (a clean pkg-config environment is required)
- LibVNCServer is no longer 'bundled', instead you need to install the devel
  package for your Linux distribution (in case of openSUSE Tumbleweed for
  example this can be accomplished with "sudo zypper in LibVNCServer-devel")
- audio encoding through FFmpeg's libavcodec
- audio server sending the MAME audio stream via UDP to connected clients
- cleaner last-60-frames statistics, now including the current audio codec's
  compression ratio
- improved / more effective algorithm for finding and updating changed parts
  of the screen (the frame buffer is internally subdivided as a checkerboard,
  and each of its squares (50x50 pixelsÂ²) is checked for changed pixels
  individually and updated as a block)

v0.1, 15-APR-2015:

- initial public version
