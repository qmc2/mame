v0.2, 12-NOV-2016:

- rebuilt from scratch for modern MAME's OSD interface
- Linux only for now (a clean pkg-config environment is required)
- LibVNCServer is no longer 'bundled', instead you need to install the devel
  package for your Linux distribution (in case of openSUSE Tumbleweed for
  example this can be accomplished with "sudo zypper in LibVNCServer-devel")

v0.1, 15-APR-2015:

- initial public version
